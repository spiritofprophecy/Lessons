 Ellen White knew when the Bible was using symbols, figure, represent, shadows and types and anti types. In this instance she does not say “144000 represents” but rather “The living saints, 144,000 in number” in all her writings she has maintained the number as not a symbolic. 

If we put something symbolic which God has not. Than it will not bring the lessons God  intended. Thus Satan would win because people will not have the truth on that subject of so great importance. Hence the 144,000 is a literal number.

Rev7:4 And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel. 

Who are the Israelites of today?


• In order to be purified and to remain pure, Seventh-day Adventists must have the Holy Spirit in their hearts and in their homes. The Lord has given me light that when the Israel of today humble themselves before Him, and cleanse the soul-temple from all defilement, He will hear their prayers in behalf of the sick and will bless in the use of His remedies for disease.9T 164.1

The sealing will take place in modern Israel (SDA) 

Why are they called virgins?

“They are called virgins because they profess a pure faith” (COL 406.3) the ten virgins are called virgins because of the pure faith. The 144000 are called virgins because of professing a pure faith. Meaning they will have to be in the church whose doctrine is not polluted. The SDA been the church whose doctrine is God given and pure. Then by the time the sealing begins they will have to be in the SDA church. This gives another proof that the sealing will be only in SDA church.


Will the 144000 ever die

“The living saints 144,000 in number” (EW 15) Ellen White calls them “living saints”
Joel 2:2,8 a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations.
8 and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.

This great people who have never existed and non more after them are the 144,000 who are to be reviewed to the world after the sealing. This people (144,000) will not die even if you try killing them. Isaiah 54:17 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. 

Gods people have always been a victim of death by been killed. This promise is to his servants who can not be wounded by a sword ⚔️ (the 144000)

Again, "They sing a new song"....which no man can learn save the 144,000....for it is the song of their experience,--an experience such as no other company have ever had." How can it be possible for all to sing the same song if it is a song of their experience except they all have the same experience? Those who had been in the grave would have the experience of death, grave, resurrection, and receiving a new body. But those who never died have seen the fulfillment of Ezekiel 9; Isaiah 63; Isaiah 60; the closing of the third angel's message, (the loud cry, close of probation), all of the seven last plagues, and they sing this song (of their experience and deliverance) "which no man can learn save the 144,000."
