 <h2>THE Two SEALS</h2> <br>

The first seal is the sabbath seal. “The fourth commandment alone of all the ten con- tains the seal of the great Lawgiver, the Creator of the heav- ens and the earth. Those who obey this commandment take upon themselves His name, and all the blessings it involves are theirs.” 6T 350. Those Who keep the sabbath holy will receive the seal of God (a sabbath seal) “The Sabbath of the fourth commandment is the seal of the living God. It points to God as the Creator, and is the sign of His rightful authority over the beings He has made. Those who obey this law will bear the seal of God, for He has set apart this day as a sign of loyalty between Himself and His people.” ST March 22, 1910.

All those who dead and will die keeping the sabbath.  receive a sabbath seal. They die in the light 💡 of the third angels message (full three angels message). They will resurrect during the special resurrection  “Graves are opened, and “many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth” “awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.” [Daniel 12:2.] All who have died in the faith of the third angel's message come forth from the tomb glorified, to hear God's covenant of peace with those who have kept his law. “They also which pierced Him,” [Revelation 1:7.] those that mocked and derided Christ's dying agonies, and the most violent opposers of his truth and his people, are raised to behold him in his glory, and to see the honor placed upon the loyal and obedient. GC88 637.1. This event is during the seventh plaque. 

These who died in the third angels message, their seal is the sabbath seal which started when the sabbath truth was reviewed somewhere after 1844.

The seal of the 144,000 is at the closing work of the church before entering the time of trouble. “in the closing work for the church, in the sealing time of the one hundred and forty-four thousand who are to stand without fault before the throne of God, will they feel most deeply the wrongs of God’s professed people” (3T266.2)

Them been Israelites(SDA) meaning they already keep the sabbath. They are not sealed only for keeping the sabbath but also for “Mark this point with care: Those who receive the pure mark of truth, wrought in them by the power of the Holy Ghost, represented by a mark by the man in linen, are those “that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done” in the church. 3T266-267

Here it is seen that the 144000 are sealed for keeping the sabbath and sighing and crying for the abomination in our churches.


So the sealing has been on going from 1844 until the 14400 are sealed. Revelation 7 deals with the sealing of the 144000.

Fellow Adventist’s this truth shows that royalty to Gods law will be rewarded. check how you keep the sabbath holy. for by so doing you will receive a seal either to be part of the special resurrection or a double seal to be part of the 144000.


“I saw that she [Mrs. Hastings, who had just died] was sealed and would come up at the voice of God and stand upon the earth, and would be with the 144,000. I saw we need not mourn for her; she would rest in the time of trouble."--Letter 10, 1850 (2SM 263).

This person died,with the sabbath seal. She will be resurrected in the special resurrection of Daniel 12:2. She will be with the 144,000 but not one of them.

What will happen to those not sealed?

“What is the seal of the living God, which is placed in the foreheads of His people? It is a mark which angels, but not human eyes, can read; for the destroying angel must see this mark of redemption.” 4BC 1161.      “The destroying angel is soon to go forth again, not to destroy the first-born alone, but “to slay utterly old and young, both men, women and little children” who have not the mark. RH September 19, 1854, par. 13
     
We remember that rev 7:1-2 has 9 angels. The four angles who were told to hurt the earth 🌍 are the destroying angel of Ezekiel 9.

“This sealing of the servants of God is the same that was shown to Ezekiel in vision. John also had been a witness of this most startling revelation  (TM 445) meaning Ezekiel 9 and rev 7 are same visions

Ezekiel saw the sealing in Ezekiel 9 we read the following “Ezekiel 9:1 He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand. And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar. And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side; And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof. And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.

Fellow Adventist’s do we we realize the danger we are in? Those who are not sealed will be literally killed in our churches. This is a life and death matter! Every Adventist’s should seek to know how to escape the slaughter of Ezekiel 9 inspiration says “Study the 9th chapter of Ezekiel. These words will be literally fulfilled; yet the time is passing, and the people are asleep. They refuse to humble their souls and to be converted. Not a great while longer will the Lord bear with the people who have such great and important truths revealed to them, but who refuse to bring these truths into their individual experience. The time is short. God is calling; will you hear? Will you receive His message? Will you be converted before it is too late? Soon, very soon, every case will be decided for eternity. Letter 106, 1909, pp. 2, 3, 5, 7. (To “The churches in Oakland and Berkeley,” September 26, 1909.) 1MR 260.2

Here is a point where if we love our lives we would like to know the depth of the matter.
