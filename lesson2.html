 <h1>REVIVAL AND REFORMATION </h1>

             <h3>Introduction </h3>
Many today have a hunger for something more than just “playing church” and going through the motions of the Christian life. They want a genuine experience with Christ—for themselves and for the church....God is calling those who say they are followers of Jesus Christ to forsake the ways of the world and to recommit their lives to Him. It is time for a genuine revival and reformation in God’s church. This can happen only under the power of God’s Spirit, and God’s Spirit cannot be given to those who profess to be His people until they know by experience what repentance and reformation is....Truly born-again Christians not only talk about Christ but live lives that testify that they are, in fact, followers of the Lord Jesus Christ. Revival is being born again; reformation is living a life of obedience through the power of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit that “Heaven is waiting to bestow.”

     Revival and reformation 
A revival and a reformation must take place, under the ministra- tion of the Holy Spirit. Revival and reformation are two different things. Revival signifies a renewal of spiritual life, a quickening of the powers of mind and heart, a resurrection from spiritual death. Reformation signifies a reorganization, a change in ideas and the- ories, habits and practices. Reformation will not bring forth the good fruit of righteousness unless it is connected with the revival of the Spirit. Revival and reformation are to do their appointed work, and in doing this work they must blend.—The Review and Herald, February 25, 1902.

revival =  “making alive again those who have been alive but have. fallen into what is called a cold, or dead, state. They are Christians but they need reviving to bring them back to their first love and Christians healthy. Something may have gone wrong in the Christians journey and a form of godliness is maintained which is without the power of the spirit (obedience to all truth). Revival awakens us to the true condition we are in and how far we have departed from God without noticing. 

Once awakened to our backsliding and are convicted of it. We begin a work to fill the gap that has been created between God and us. This is reformation. 

reformation means improvements or collection to a proper service to God that is based on Scripture. Reformation comes not by what we can do but by the grace of God. Reformation is the working of the spirit on our heart to turn us from our evil ways to a better way.


They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.

THE CHURCH CONDITION 

"The Lord has not closed Heaven to us, but our own course of continual backsliding has separated us from God. Pride, covetousness, and love of the world have lived in the heart without fear of banishment or condemnation. Grievous and presumptuous sins have dwelt among us. And yet the general opinion is that the church is flourishing, and that peace and spiritual prosperity are in all her borders.  The church has turned back from following Christ her Leader, and is steadily retreating toward Egypt. Yet few are alarmed or astonished at their want of spiritual power. Doubt and even disbelief of the testimonies of the Spirit of God, is leavening our churches everywhere." -- Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 217.

"We have wandered away from the old landmarks. Let us return. If the Lord be God, serve him: if Baal, serve him. Which side will you be on?" -- Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 137.

"As Jesus views the state of his professed followers today, he sees base ingratitude, hollow formalism, hypocritical insincerity, Pharisaical pride and apostasy." -- Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 72.

"Men and women are in the last hours of probation, and yet are careless and stupid, and ministers have no power to arouse them; they are asleep themselves. Sleeping preachers preaching to a sleeping people!" -- Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 337.

"one sinner may diffuse darkness that will exclude the light of God from the entire congregation." -- Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 265.

"Who can truthfully say, 'Our gold is tried in the fire; our garments are unspotted by the world'? I saw our Instructor pointing to the garments of so-called righteousness. Stripping them off, He laid bare the defilement beneath. Then He said to me: 'Can you not see how they have pretentiously covered up their defilement and rottenness of character? "How is the faithful city become an harlot?" My Father's house is made a house of merchandise, a place whence the divine presence and glory have departed! For this cause there is weakness, and strength is lacking.'" --Testimonies, Vol. 8, p. 250.


 “The people of God are represented in the message to the Laodiceans as in a position of carnal security. They are at ease, believing themselves to be in an exalted condition of spiritual attainments....What greater deception can come upon human minds than a confidence that they are right when they are all wrong! The message of the True Witness finds the people of God in a sad deception, yet honest in that deception. They know not that their condition is deplorable in the sight of God. While those addressed are flattering themselves that they are in an exalted spiritual condition, the message of the True Witness breaks their security by the startling denunciation of their true condition of spiritual blindness, poverty, and wretchedness.
Testimonies, Vol. 3,p. 252

This is our spiritual condition and so a revival and reformation must take place.

Present revival and reformation message 

“The Reformation did not, as many suppose, end with Luther. It is to be continued to the close of this world's history. Luther had a great work to do in reflecting to others the light which God had permitted to shine upon him; yet he did not receive all the light which was to be given to the world. From that time to this, new light has been continually shining upon the Scriptures, and new truths have been constantly unfolding. GC88 148.3. 
The unfolding of scripture ( meat in due season) comes with reformation 

Isaiah 52:1 Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.

Rewrite

Revive, revive; get back to the source of your strength, church of God, reform and you will put on the righteousness of Christ, church of God. Because the rebellious and evil doers will not be among you.

Here the call to awake is accompanied by a declaration that the uncircumcised or unclean will not be part of God’s people. Hence the last revival message is a call to awake (revive). Because the wicked will not be part of God’s church (after Ezekiel 9). This is exactly what the shepherds rod teach. The shepherds rod is a call for revival and reformation declaring that if we don’t revive and reform (remaining wicked) we will be slain by the angels inspiration says 

“Many, I saw, were flattering themselves that they were good Christians, who have not a single ray of light from Jesus. They know not what it is to be renewed by the grace of God. They have no living experience for themselves in the things of God. And I saw that the Lord was whetting His sword in heaven to cut them down. Oh, that every lukewarm professor could realize the clean work that God is about to make among His professed people! Testimonies, volume,1. Pg 190

You see fellow Adventist’s the slaughter of Ezekiel 9 is not a made up story as people are trying to make it look. It’s the prophets who where shown this event remember Noah was not believed until the rain began. are we going to wait until the slaying begins for us to believe?  

The judgement begins with the church (James 4:17). is the church not to be warned when her time of judgement has come? 

The scripture says 
Micah 6:9 The LORD'S voice crieth unto the city (church), and the man of wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.

Micah 7:14 Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage 

Why are the scripture telling us that “hear the rod” and “feed” on it? How can you know if the shepherds rod is the rod spoken of here if you don’t read it and know for yourself. 

Every work of reformation has been opposed by leading men do you think that the last revival call will not be opposed by our leading men?  Satan is always at work.
Inspiration says

“I asked the meaning of the shaking I had seen, and was shown that it would be caused by the straight testimony called forth by the counsel of the True Witness to the Laodiceans. This will have its effect upon the heart of the receiver, and will lead him to exalt the standard and pour forth the straight truth. Some will not bear this straight testimony. They will rise up against it, and this will cause a shaking among God’s people” 1T74

The straight truth that shows our true condition and danger. Is what brings the shaking. Where ever the shepherds rod has been preached a revival and reformation has taken place to these who receive it and opposed by another class. The results are that a shaking takes place. Even if we are opposed God has given us a work to warn the church of the fulfillment of Ezekiel 9. 

This revival is reconnecting our life with Jesus by confessing and repenting our sins and backsliding.

This is what God wants to happen.

“Others rushed from the darkness as though it were life or death with them, and the cry went forth as I never heard it before, “What shall I do to be saved?” [Acts 16:30.] It seemed as though the people were reined up for final judgment. There was confession of sins; there was rejoicing over sins forgiven. But all did not participate. Some had not been walking in company with Jesus, but apart from Him, and therefore did not realize His presence, but seemed to think it was not Jesus. 4LtMs, Lt 70, 1886, par. 22

It is surely time to awake out of sleep, to arise from the dead, that Christ may give you life. 


“A revival of true godliness among us is the greatest and most urgent of all our needs. To seek this should be our first work” 

Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
      
     TRUE REVIVAL 
“ Revivals brought deep heart searching and humility. They were characterized by solemn, earnest appeals to the sinner, by yearning compassion for the purchase of the blood of Christ. Men and women prayed and wrestled with God for the salvation of souls. The fruits of such revivals were seen in souls who shrank not at self-denial and sacrifice, but rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer reproach and trial for the sake of Christ. Men beheld a transformation in the lives of those who had professed the name of Jesus. The community was benefited by their influence. ...
This is the result of the work of the Spirit of God. There is no evidence of genuine repentance unless it works reformation”

“With every truly converted soul the relation to God and to eternal things will be the great topic of life” 

“It is only as the law of God is restored to its rightful position that there can be a revival of primitive faith and godliness among His professed people”

The fruits of true revival is seeing and know our true condition. Reconnecting to God by self examination confessing and repentance. Willing to give up the love of the world for God. Obedience to the divine law as part of life style. 


   FALSE REVIVAL 

“Popular revivals are too often carried by appeals to the imagina- tion, by exciting the emotions, by gratifying the love for what is new and startling. Converts thus gained have little desire to listen to Bible truth, little interest in the testimony of prophets and apostles. Unless a religious service has something of a sensational character, it has no attractions for them. A message which appeals to unimpassioned reason awakens no response. The plain warnings of God’s word, relating directly to their eternal interests, are unheeded”

“Wherever men neglect the testimony of the Bible, turning away from those plain, soul-testing truths which require self-denial and renunciation of the world, there we may be sure that God’s blessing is not bestowed”

“The sanctification now gaining prominence in the religious world carries with it a spirit of self-exaltation and a disregard for the law of God that mark it as foreign to the religion of the Bible”

“The desire for an easy religion that requires no striving, no self-denial, no divorce from the follies of the world, has made the doctrine of faith, and faith only, a popular doctrine”

False revival are characterized no genuine repentance and no obedience to the law of God. 


Let’s examine our selves and “Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls” 


THE LAW OF GOD 
Psalms 19:7 “The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.  For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light” 

The law of God makes one wise to salvation and also is a light directing a Christians steps. By the law we get knowledge of what is sin and what is good. The keeping of the law makes us avoid the sin with its consequences. 

James 1:24-25. The law was given for liberty in the human family. It’s like a mirror where we can see the character of God and check ourselves if we are reflecting the character to the world. 

James 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.    

every Christian is commanded to keep the whole law and not some. The 10 commandments are the great principles of love. It starts with me and you to change the world into obedience to the law. Which will bring love and liberty in the earth. 

Inspiration has this to say 

*There are dark passions of jealousy and revenge and hatred and malignity, lust, and wild ambition that are covered up from human observation, and the great I AM knows it all. Sins have been contemplated and yet not carried out for want of opportunity. God's law makes a record of all these. 1888 374.1

*God's law reaches the feelings and motives, as well as the outward acts. It reveals the secrets of the heart, flashing light upon things before buried in darkness. God knows every thought, every purpose, every plan, every motive.  ST July 31,  1901, par. 3

*The books of heaven record the sins that would have been committed had there been opportunity. God will bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing. By His law He measures the character of every man. As the artist transfers to the canvas the features of the face, so the features of each individual character are transferred to the books of heaven. God has a perfect photograph of every man's character, and this photograph He compares with His law. He reveals to man the defects that mar his life, and calls upon him to repent and turn from sin ST July 31,  1901, par. 3

“one wrong trait of character, one sinful desire cherished, will eventually neutralize all the power of the gospel. The prevalence of a sinful desire shows the delusion of the soul. Every indulgence of that desire strengthens the soul’s aversion to God. The pains of duty and the pleasures of sin are the cords with which Satan binds men in his snares. Those who would rather die than perform a wrong act are the only ones who will be found faithful” 5T53.2

                 THE END
