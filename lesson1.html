 <h1>THE 144000</h1>

Revelation 7:1 And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.

2 And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,  

There are four angels holding the four winds💨 and One angel having the seal of God in rev 7:1. In rev 7:2 there are four angels who are told to hurt the earth 🌍. we may not have seen this but that’s what is written. The four angels where holding the winds 💨 that the winds should not blow on earth. Their duty is simply to hold the winds nothing more. In vs two the sealing angel speaks to the angels who are given, not to hold the winds but to hurt the earth. The total number of angels in revelation 7 is 9. 4 holding the winds + 1 sealing + 4 given to hurt the earth 🌍 = 9 . This can be easily seen on the chart.

What do the winds represent 

“The time is coming when we cannot sell at any price. The decree will soon go forth prohibiting men to buy or sell of any man save him that hath the mark of the beast. *We came near having this realized in California a short time since; but this was only the threatening of the blowing of the four winds. As yet they are held by the four angels.* We are not just ready. There is a work yet to be done, and then the angels will be bidden to let go, that the four winds may blow upon the earth. That will be a decisive time for God’s children, a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation. Now is our opportunity to work. 5T 152.2. 

From the quote it is seen that the Sunday law are the winds. Them blowing will bring a time of trouble (national Sunday law.) 

The winds are to be held back and the 4 angels who are to hurt are also to wait until the sealing is over than the time of trouble will come
"Just before we entered it [the time of trouble], *we all received the seal of the living God. Then I saw the four angels cease to hold the four winds. And I saw famine, pestilence and sword, nation rose against nation, and the whole world was in confusion."*—The S.D.A. Bible Commentary 7:968 (1846).  - LDE 228.4
<br>
The two powers the winds (national Sunday law) and the  hurting angels. Are what will make this time a time of trouble such as never was.

🔎🔎🔎🔎🔎🔎🔎
LDE 228.4 says the winds are let go and famine, pestilence, war and confusion hits the earth 🌍. 5T152.2 says the winds is the national Sunday law. 

How can we harmonize the two quotes?⚖️⚖️⚖️⚖️⚖️

“Only a moment of time, as it were, yet remains. But while already nation is rising against nation and kingdom against kingdom, there is not now a general engagement. As yet the four winds are held until the servants of God shall be sealed in their foreheads. Then the powers of earth will marshal their forces for the last great battle.—Testimonies for the Church 6:14 (1900). LDE 229.2
<br>
Present time famine, pestilence and war are there.The Sunday law will appear to be just the solution to these. The world will say Everyone will be worshiping on the same day will not that bring gods favor on us? These things they will imagine and use to finish their agenda but when the  blue law is enforced. God will show his displeasure by worsening the condition. So when the national Sunday law comes wars will increase and the righteous will be accused of being the cause of troubles. for they refuse to worship the beast or keeping Sunday holy.

Hence the  blowing winds comes with the blue law and wars and other trouble.

Is the 144000 symbolic 

2 Corinthians 13:1 In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
