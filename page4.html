 <h3>THE FIRST FRUITS </h3>

1 Peter 4:17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?

We remember the parable of wheat and tares. The field been the church. Wheat are the faithful and tares are the wicked. They grow together until the harvest. in the time of harvest the separation is done. 

“I then saw the third angel. Said my accompanying angel, “Fearful is his work. Awful is his mission. He is the angel that is to select the wheat from the tares, and seal, or bind, the wheat for the heavenly garner. These things should engross the whole mind, the whole attention.” (EW 118)

The separation is in the time of harvest (judgement period) which begins with the church. 

Crops gathered first from the field are first fruits. The 144,000 been the first to be gathered (seal) of the living, makes them first fruits of the living. When first fruits are gathered. The second fruits are than gathered or the whole field. The second fruits are the great multitude that no man could number out of all nations rev 7:9. The harvest (judgement of the living) is seen to produce two groups of people the 144000 from the church and the great multitude from all nations. The connection is that the first fruits from the church will be sent to gather the second fruits from all nations. 

We have first fruits of the dead, Jesus and those that arose with him.(DA 785.4 786.2) 1 Corin 15:20) the 144,000 are the first fruits of the living. 

Let’s hear what Isaiah says 
Isaiah 66:15-20 For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. 
👇👇👇👇👇
For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many...And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.


The slain by God will be many. those that escape the slaughter are sent to all nations preaching the gospel and a great multitude is saved from all nations. 

Micah 4:1 But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it. And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his path.

This message calls for every honesty SDA to deal truly with our selves it’s our wickedness that has brought this great and dreadful day on us. Gods call is 

Isaiah 52:1 Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.

Nahum 1:15 O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.


Zechariah 14:21 and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.

Ezekiel 9 shows the end of sin and sinners in the church. Hence it’s the fearful separation of wheat and tares. 

Who planted the tares? Satan .
Who would want the tares to be part of God’s church? Satan.

When the church is purified than will it reach this condition 👇👇👇

Ephesians 5:27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.


“The true people of God, who have the spirit of the work of the Lord and the salvation of souls at heart, will ever view sin in its real, sinful character. They will always be on the side of faithful and plain dealing with sins which easily beset the people of God. Especially in the closing work for the church, in the sealing time of the one hundred and forty-four thousand who are to stand without fault before the throne of God, will they feel most deeply the wrongs of God’s professed people. This is forcibly set forth by the prophet’s illustration of the last work under the figure of the men each having a slaughter weapon in his hand. One man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side. “And the Lord said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.”

“Who are standing in the counsel of God at this time? Is it those who virtually excuse wrongs among the professed people of God and who murmur in their hearts, if not openly, against those who would reprove sin? Is it those who take their stand against them and sympathize with those who commit wrong? No, indeed! Unless they repent, and leave the work of Satan in oppressing those who have the burden of the work and in holding up the hands of sinners in Zion, they will never receive the mark of God’s sealing approval. They will fall in the general destruction of the wicked, represented by the work of the five men bearing slaughter weapons. Mark this point with care: Those who receive the pure mark of truth, wrought in them by the power of the Holy Ghost, represented by a mark by the man in linen, are those “that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done” in the church. Their love for purity and the honor and glory of God is such, and they have so clear a view of the exceeding sinfulness of sin, that they are represented as being in agony, even sighing and crying. Read the ninth chapter of Ezekiel. (3T266)

Brother you have to separate your self from sin. 

And warn others of the sins that a common in our churches warn of the destruction of Ezekiel 9

Isaiah 58:1 Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.

“God is sifting His people. He will have a clean and holy church....As we near the judgment, all will manifest their true character, and it will be made plain to what company they belong. The sieve is moving. Let us not say: Stay Thy hand, O God. The church must be purged, and it will be. ( 1T 99.4-100) 

“But the days of purification of the church are hastening on apace. God will have a people pure and true. In the mighty sifting soon to take place we shall be better able to measure the strength of Israel. The signs reveal that the time is near when the Lord will manifest that His fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His floor” 5T 79.4

Note here the slaying is called the clean work 

“Many, I saw, were flattering themselves that they were good Christians, who have not a single ray of light from Jesus. They know not what it is to be renewed by the grace of God. They have no living experience for themselves in the things of God. And I saw that the Lord was whetting His sword in heaven to cut them down. Oh, that every lukewarm professor could realize the clean work that God is about to make among His professed people! Dear friends, do not deceive yourselves concerning your condition. You cannot deceive God. Says the True Witness: “I know thy works.” ( 1T 190 ) 

Isa. 63:1-3, "Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat? I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with Me: For I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in My fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon My garments, and I will stain all My raiment."

The picture is not a pleasant one to look at, but it is true. It is God's "strange work." Edom is another name for Esau Gen. 25:30. Esau had his name changed because he sold his birthright for a bowl of pottage. The class here are termed Edom because they have sold their birthright for self-gratification to satisfy lust, the god of appetite (disregard of health reform), Bozrah means "sheepfold," a symbol of the church.

When the purification is done the church will be ready to face the time of trouble (national Sunday law)

Clad in the armor of Christ’s righteousness, the church is to enter upon her final conflict. “Fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners” (Song of Solomon 6:10), she is to go forth into all the world, conquering and to conquer. (Pk 725) read also Joel 2:2-10. Jere 51:20-23


Rev14:4 These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. 

To understand what it means to follow the lamp, we must first tress 🔎🔎 the steps of the lamp (Jesus).

He was first in heaven ,He come on earth, dead resurrected and went back to heaven, 1844 he want in the most holy place. during the sealing he comes to slay the wicked . Last he comes to gather the saints to heaven. 

Each of these movements is accompanied with a message (on earth). 
when he was in heaven he gave sacrifice of beast as a message of the Israelites. When he was on earth dead and resurrected and went to heaven,the message was that of a risen savior. When he entered the mostly holy the message is the sanctuary message in connection with the judgement of the dead. Now that he is to perform a cleaning work Ezekiel 9, His message is in the “shepherds rod”

Micah 6:9 The LORD'S voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it. 

Micah 7:14 Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.  

The primary purpose of The Shepherd's Rod is to unlock the long-concealed mystery concerning the ever-challenging and much discussed subject of the 144,000 (Rev. 14:1), with the central object in view of bringing about among God's people that "thorough reformation" foretold by the Spirit of Prophecy (Testimonies, Vol. 8, p. 251).

These truths, Divinely revealed, are of supreme importance to the church just now because of the trying, sifting circumstances through which God's people are soon to pass. Being vital concerns to salvation, they call for decided action from ministry and laity alike to separate themselves from all worldliness and to anchor themselves on the Solid Rock by obedience to all the truth known to the church, if they would escape the forthcoming ruin that is to take every sinner.

Its dominant doctrinal concern being the truth of the 144,000, and a correct understanding of it being a life-and-death matter to all, the Rod unfolds it from several different angles, each urging the Denomination to prepare for the glorious deliverance of the saints and against the inglorious destruction of the sinners as foretokened by the marking and slaying recorded in Ezekiel 9.

No new denomination is advocated, on the contrary, such is unmitigatedly opposed. And finally, irrefutable proof is brought forth that the Seventh-day Adventist Denomination has been the instrumentality of God since 1844 to carry on His work on earth, and that the Rod adds "power and force" "to the third message." -- Early Writings, p. 277.

Following the lamp is simply to keep pace with the light 💡 God sends, by personal investigation.

CONCLUSION 

“Not all who profess to keep the Sabbath will be sealed. There are many even among those who teach the truth to others who will not receive the seal of God in their foreheads. They had the light of truth, they knew their Master's will, they understood every point of our faith, but they had not corresponding works. These who were so familiar with prophecy and the treasures of divine wisdom should have acted their faith. They should have commanded their households after them, that by a well-ordered family they might present to the world the influence of the truth upon the human heart. 5T 213.2

“Not one of us will ever receive the seal of God while our characters have one spot or stain upon them. It is left with us to remedy the defects in our characters, to cleanse the soul temple of every defilement. Then the latter rain will fall upon us as the early rain fell upon the disciples on the Day of Pentecost. 5T 214.2
